## Preview Rpc

This feature allows you to preview your status before you send it, so you can check spelling, formatting, and how it looks with different images or text. This helps you ensure your status is accurate and polished before sharing it.

<Callout type="info">
**Limitations**
- Timestamps are not included in Preview.
- It is intended to give you an idea of how your Rpc will look on Discord, but it is not a guarantee of exactly how it will appear. 
</Callout>

    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: "0.50rem"}}>

        className='h-[calc(60vh/1.8)] max-h-[700px] lg:h-fit lg:max-h-fit'
