Kizzy allows you to share your current activity on Discord by detecting what app you're using on your device. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to enable app detection RPC in Kizzy:

<div className="steps-container">
### Open App Detection 
Open the Kizzy app on your device then click on the `App Detection` card.

### Select an App 
You will see a list of installed apps on your device. To enable app detection for a particular `app`, flip the switch next to its name.

### Enable App Detection
Scroll to the top of the screen and click on the `Enable App Detection`.

### Open your app 
Now Open the `app` that you have just enabled.
### RPC Activated 
Your `app's` rich presence will now appear on Discord as long as you use the `app`.

</div>
<Callout type='info'>
Please note that App Detection will not work for the following apps:

1. `Discord`: This is to allow users to use Discord and other apps simultaneously or use splitscreen to check if the RPC is working correctly.

2. `Kizzy`: This is to prevent Kizzy from always setting itself as the current running app.

</Callout>
By following these steps, you can easily share your current app activity on Discord using Kizzy.
