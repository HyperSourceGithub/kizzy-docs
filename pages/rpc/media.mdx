<Callout type="info">
The `large image` in the Rpc is determined as follows:

- If there is a thumbnail art in the [media controller](https://developer.android.com/static/images/about/versions/11/media-controls.png) ,Kizzy will automatically set it as the `large image` in the RPC.
- If there is no thumbnail art in the [media controller](https://developer.android.com/static/images/about/versions/11/media-controls.png), Kizzy will use the **icon of the app** that is currently playing media as the `large image` in the RPC.

</Callout>


By following these steps, you can easily share your current media activity on Discord using Kizzy.
