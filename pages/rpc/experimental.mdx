# Experimental Rpc

### What is Experimental Rpc?

Experimental Rpc is a feature in Kizzy that constantly switches between Apps Rpc and Media Rpc. This allows you to display a variety of information on your Discord status, including the apps you are using and the media you are playing.

<Callout type="warning">
This Rpc is only available for members of our Discord server. If you are not a member, the Experimental Rpc will not be shown to you. [Join Now](https://discord.gg/vUPc7zzpV5) to access this feature.

### Here's how it works:
<div className="steps-container">

### Enable Your Apps
Enable the apps you want to show in your Discord status by going to the Apps Rpc and turning on the corresponding switches.

### Turn on the Rpc
Enable Experimental Rpc in by turning on the switch in home screen.

### Test an App
Open an app that you have enabled in Apps Rpc and that can have media playback (such as YouTube or Spotify).

### How it detects ?
- The Experimental Rpc will switch to Apps Rpc and display the app you are using on your Discord status.

- If you start playing media in the app (such as a song or video), the Experimental Rpc will switch to Media Rpc and display the media information on your Discord status.

- If you switch to a different app that you have enabled in Apps Rpc and that can have media playback, the Experimental Rpc will update to show the new app on your Discord status.

In this way, Experimental Rpc allows you to display a wide range of information on your Discord status, including the apps you are using and the media you are playing.
