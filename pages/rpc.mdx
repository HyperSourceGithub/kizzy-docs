# Rich Presence in Kizzy

#### In Kizzy, there are five different types of rich presence that you can use:

- **App Detection**: Displays rpc for the app/game you're currently using on your device.

- **Media RPC**: Displays rpc for the music or video you're currently listening to or watching.

- **Console RPC**: Displays rpc form the console games list.

- **Custom RPC**: Allows you to create your own custom rpc to display on Discord.

- **Experimental RPC**: Allows you to test out new RPCs that are in development.
